## Contact Center Implementation

I have been heavily involved in helping my IT team and our business partners in choosing the right technology to re-implement Contact Center. Its been an exciting journey so far as i am learning so much along the way. On a high level, you are better off picking a technolgy stack which is in the cloud. This should seem like a easy choice, but in the world of telephony until recently, its been hard to implement 100% cloud based infrastructure.
