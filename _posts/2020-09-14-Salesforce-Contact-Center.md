## Contact Center Implementation

* I have been heavily involved in helping our IT team and our business partners in choosing the right technology to re-implement Contact Center. Its been an exciting journey so far as i am learning so much along the way. On a high level, you are better off picking a cloud based technology stack and give more preference to vertical integration. This should seem like a easy choice, but in the world of telephony, until recently, its been hard to implement 100% cloud based solution.

* That changed when [Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/) and [Service Cloud Voice](https://www.salesforce.com/products/service-cloud/solutions/call-center-management/) was introduced in Summer '20.

* This is the first time Telephony is getting a huge upgrade!
